MEAN stack
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). Express with HTML and JavaScript follows a traditional multi-page approach, where the server renders HTML dynamically and sends it to the client, making it simpler but often slower due to full-page reloads. In contrast, a Single-Page Application (SPA) loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content using JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue, providing a smoother user experience but requiring more client-side logic and API interactions.


Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database? Backends use a NoSQL MongoDB database for its flexible schema, scalability, and efficient handling of large, unstructured, or rapidly changing data in modern web applications.


How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? JSON is a lightweight data format used for storing and exchanging data, whereas JavaScript is a programming language used for building dynamic web applications; JSON acts as a bridge between frontend and backend by enabling seamless data transfer between them via APIs.


Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components. In the full stack process, refactoring may involve optimizing database queries for faster responses, restructuring API endpoints for cleaner logic, or modularizing frontend UI components for better reusability; reusable UI components improve consistency, reduce development time, and make maintenance easier across an application.
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application. API testing methods in a full stack application include unit testing for individual endpoints, integration testing to ensure data flows correctly between services, and performance testing to assess response times under load. Secure endpoints often require authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and authorization (e.g., role-based access), making testing more complex by necessitating token management, encryption handling, and access control validation.
